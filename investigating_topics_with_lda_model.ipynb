       "'As I mentioned at the end of my “International Love Yourself Day,” Valentine’s Day is followed by National Singles Awareness Day. I’ve been musing on that ever since.I like to parse the language we use to adumbrate bigger things, my favorite being losing weight (“Honey, have you seen my weight? I left it by the door 15 minutes ago and now I can’t find it!”). In the case of National Singles Awareness Day, I have couple of inferences to point out.National days, I know from my 25 years of living in a neighborhood that overlooks Manhattan, the Empire State Building is lit in colors commemorating the occasion.  Tonight it will be all red. On St. Patrick’s Day it will be all green. At the end of the month, it will be green and blue for National Eating Disorders Week.Source: Frances KuffelGiven that Singles Awareness Day is a nationally recognized...thing (?)...what color would the Empire State Building be bathed in to...honor (?)...one-half of the population? Beige, maybe? (Are we a group that favors neutral-colors until we hook up with someone who has strong ideas on decorating?) Red and black plaid? (Are we a group of hermits in the woods?) White? (Isn’t our unmarried state waiting for the walk down the aisle?)And this word, “awareness”! It’s usually associated with a problem – breast cancer or blind people (there’s a whole month for the blind, October). Is being single a problem? “Awareness” often goes with donating to a cause, but I don’t know what the cause is. Getting us partnered up?  Making us feel less alone? Where there’s a cause there’s usually a foundation.  Perhaps a National Single People Foundation could collect pennies at grocery store check-outs to deliver chicken soup and Robitussun when we’re down with a bad cold, or to get us to the doctor us in our lonely decrepitude. A March phone marathon to singletons, reminding us not to give up hope and jump out a window would be useful.Or are partnered people expected simply to cast a thought our way on February 15th, shake their heads in just short of pity?In the bigger picture, this is a national occasion, folks! We singles are the go-to babysitters, confidents of nieces and nephews, care-givers of choice for aging parents (actually, I didn’t do that one, to my regret and some shame: Thanks, Jim!).  We are here for you when you need a buddy because your S.I. isn’t interested or available.  At the very least, our not-yet-founded foundation should be passing out beige ribbons, or crinkled paper untethered balloon lapel decorations like the poppies on Veterans’ Day. (Wikipedia defines remembrance ribbons as “symbols meant to show support or raise consciousness for a cause\", furthering my argument with rhetoric above.) Our foundation could haunt bank ATMs, where we deposit our paychecks that won’t be shared with college savings or paying for braces. Salad bars, the cereal aisle in grocery stores and department stores selling clown figurines are also places to find proud single people and the civilians who sympathize with us.But why stop there? Why doesn’t National Singles Awareness Day have some oomph behind it? Why aren’t Hallmark, FTD, and Godiva making a bunch of money out of us? Perhaps such companies don’t understand what would appropriate for National Singles Awareness Day. Here are some ideas:Think cards bearing images of said-balloons or ribbons, empty Chinese take-out cartons with the chopsticks still in them, unmade beds with one side in perfect order, a refrigerator stocked with carrot sticks, hummus and 12 bottles of white wine.Here are some verses:For my single friend:Remember: Jesus was single.You’re in holy company.Sending you prayers on this special day.Here’s to be being single –  I want to give you a jingle.If you’d pick up the phone,  I would have to pay for a card.Congratulations on 20 years of being alone!Can you help with my daughter’s college loan?We singles love chocolate as much as anyone else. Nestlé, take note: boxes could be based on Rubik’s cubes or feature Bridget Jones, the Gilmore Girls or Warren Beatty. Make the chocolate sockets inside any shape you like, but be sure to put the square candy in the round holes, etc.FTD: stock up on black roses, and get familiar with the language of flowers. Given that this is the 21st century, we won’t consider flowers that represent chastity or innocence, but that still leaves some lovely bouquets for single people. Myrtle flowers and yellow carnations proclaim \"no!\" to love. Source: fleuryste/PixabayRed roses and white heather wishes good luck in love, and globe amaranth, which look like large clover flowers, with live oak leaves is a sign of respect for the single who is devoted to lifelong liberty.For the do-it-yourself awarenesser, consider the gender of your foster singleton. If you have a bachelor in your life, consider buying him bright dishes, cleaning his freezer or planting flowers (see ibid.) These are things men might not get around to. For the lovable, madcap Mary Richards, assembling furniture, hanging pictures, fixing leaky faucets and a big package of Oreos will always be appreciated.Here are some other gift ideas:An assortment of frozen dinners or flavored instant oatmealsGoldfish, with bowl and foodA Netflix or Hulu subscriptionAdult coloring books and pencils; origami kit; jigsaw puzzleA grow garden with seeds (see ibid.)Selfie extenderA Hummel figurine or Lionel train accessoryA dog bed or cat scratching post (hint!)New sweat pants + a bottle of stain removerSoap-on-a-rope or bath saltsTea kettleThe point is, we want stuff! It is time to move forward in acknowledging our singles.  The day’s name should be changed to National Singles Appreciation Day. We are not a problem or a cause. We’re paying for your kids’ public education, shouldering a heftier tax burden, paying into social security we probably won\\'t live long enough to piss off Marco Rubio, and keeping Tindr, Matchdotcom and Zoosk in the business of making Facebook profitable.Given all that, maybe it should be called National Single Undying-Gratitude Day.'"

      "Why Do People Cheat?\n",
      "Infidelity has many complicated layers that relationship science is still unpacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source: Diego Cervo/ShutterstockInfidelity is a complicated topic. Depending on how one defines it, some studies report that between 30 and 50 percent of people have engaged in emotional and/or physical intimacy with someone other than their romantic partner.The question of why people step out of their relationships has intrigued me for years. For my dissertation1, I asked young adults who had engaged in extradyadic intimacy to tell the story of why they decided to be intimate with someone other than their girlfriend or boyfriend. I expected clean-cut answers and hypothesized simple narratives: “My partner wasn’t as intimate with me as I wanted them to be, so I went to find that intimacy somewhere else,” or “My partner didn’t let me pursue the career I wanted, my interests that I held dear, my dreams for the future; I broke out of my relationship to try to take the steering wheel back in my own hands.”And then something happened as I examined the data: In about 60 percent of the responses on reasons for cheating, support for the above narratives emerged — primary relationships weren’t helping young adults fulfill their needs, so they tried to fulfill those needs elsewhere. But the other 40 percent told a more nuanced story. For them, infidelity was not something they “decided” to do, as my prompt had implied. Rather, it was something that “just happened.”Before explaining this finding as a lack of insight or lack of ownership of actions from these participants, let’s unpack this message. Many young adults stated that cheating on their partners was not something they intended to do; several ingredients combined to create a recipe of infidelity, often as shocking for the person as it was for his/her/their partner. These ingredients tended to include being under the influence of alcohol, the availability of another person to whom one is attracted, and the emotional vulnerability of feeling unhappy about oneself and/or about one’s relationship. These findings are consistent with other research indicating that infidelity is more layered than the narrative of “once a cheater, always a cheater.”2 Put a different way, it is within the realm of possibility that any of us could be the person who had a bad day or a fight with our partner, went to a bar to relax, and met someone whom we found attractive. Any of us could unintentionally find ourselves in an environment that might lead to infidelity.Given this, what guidance might we take from these findings? [A caveat: This was one study conducted with a fairly homogeneous sample of young adults (ages 18-25), and interpretations should be made with caution.]1. Identify your needs for yourself, and communicate them to your partner. What are some primary needs that you want fulfilled in a romantic relationship? What happens if those needs aren’t fulfilled?2. Ask about your partner's needs, and be open to how you can fulfill them.3. Talk to your partner. Awareness that no one is ever “immune” to taking part in infidelity might spark conversations among partners about their boundaries and vulnerabilities.\n"
